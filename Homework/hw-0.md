Task 1
------

1. Create a module named `HW0.T1` and define the following type in it:

   ```
   data a <-> b = Iso (a -> b) (b -> a)

   flipIso :: (a <-> b) -> (b <-> a)
   flipIso (Iso f g) = Iso g f

   runIso :: (a <-> b) -> (a -> b)
   runIso (Iso f _) = f
   ```

2. Implement the following functions and isomorphisms:

   ```
   distrib :: Either a (b, c) -> (Either a b, Either a c)
   assocPair :: (a, (b, c)) <-> ((a, b), c)
   assocEither :: Either a (Either b c) <-> Either (Either a b) c
   ```

> Note: `data a <-> b = Iso (a -> b) (b -> a)` is the same as `data Iso a b = Iso (a -> b) (b -> a)`
but with type name in operator form. It requires `TypeOperators` language extension to be enabled.

Task 2
------

1. Create a module named `HW0.T2` and define the following type in it:

   ```
   type Not a = a -> Void
   ```

2. Implement the following functions and isomorphisms:

   ```
   doubleNeg :: a -> Not (Not a)
   reduceTripleNeg :: Not (Not (Not a)) -> Not a
   ```

Task 3
------

1. Create a module named `HW0.T3` and define the following combinators in it:

   ```
   s :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
   s f g x = f x (g x)

   k :: a -> b -> a
   k x y = x
   ```

2. Using *only those combinators* and function application (i.e. no lambdas,
   pattern matching, and so on) define the following additional combinators:

   ```
   i :: a -> a
   compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
   contract :: (a -> a -> b) -> (a -> b)
   permute :: (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c)
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   i x = x         -- No (parameters on the LHS disallowed)
   i = \x -> x     -- No (lambdas disallowed)
   i = Prelude.id  -- No (only use s and k)
   i = s k k       -- OK
   i = (s k) k     -- OK (parentheses for grouping allowed)
   ```

Task 4
------

1. Create a module named `HW0.T4`.

2. Using the `fix` combinator from the `Data.Function` module define the
   following functions:

   ```
   repeat' :: a -> [a]             -- behaves like Data.List.repeat
   map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]  -- behaves like Data.List.map
   fib :: Natural -> Natural       -- computes the n-th Fibonacci number
   fac :: Natural -> Natural       -- computes the factorial
   ```

   Do not use explicit recursion. For example:

   ```
   repeat' = Data.List.repeat     -- No (obviously)
   repeat' x = x : repeat' x      -- No (explicit recursion disallowed)
   repeat' x = fix (x:)           -- OK
   ```

Task 5
------

1. Create a module named `HW0.T5` and define the following type in it:

   ```
   type Nat a = (a -> a) -> a -> a
   ```

2. Implement the following functions:

   ```
   nz :: Nat a
   ns :: Nat a -> Nat a

   nplus, nmult :: Nat a -> Nat a -> Nat a

   nFromNatural :: Natural -> Nat a
   nToNum :: Num a => Nat a -> a
   ```

3. The following equations must hold:

   ```
   nToNum nz       ==  0
   nToNum (ns x)   ==  1 + nToNum x

   nToNum (nplus a b)   ==   nToNum a + nToNum b
   nToNum (nmult a b)   ==   nToNum a * nToNum b
   ```

Task 6
------

1. Create a module named `HW0.T6` and define the following values in it:

   ```
   a = distrib (Left ("AB" ++ "CD" ++ "EF"))     -- distrib from HW0.T1
   b = map isSpace "Hello, World"
   c = if 1 > 0 || error "X" then "Y" else "Z"
   ```

2. Determine the WHNF (weak head normal form) of these values:

   ```
   a_whnf = ...
   b_whnf = ...
   c_whnf = ...
   ```

> Note: This task has no automated tests and will be checked manually. You may ignore the GHC warnings about the absence of function signatures in this module.
