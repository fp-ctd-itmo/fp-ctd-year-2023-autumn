Homework #3
===========

[Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/ibu0a7Vp)

Task 1
------

1. Create a module named `HW3.T1` and define the following data types in it:

   * ```
     data Option a = None | Some a
     ```
   * ```
     data Pair a = P a a
     ```
   * ```
     data Quad a = Q a a a a
     ```
   * ```
     data Annotated e a = a :# e
     infix 0 :#
     ```
   * ```
     data Except e a = Error e | Success a
     ```
   * ```
     data Prioritised a = Low a | Medium a | High a
     ```
   * ```
     data Stream a = a :> Stream a
     infixr 5 :>
     ```
   * ```
     data List a = Nil | a :. List a
     infixr 5 :.
     ```
   * ```
     data Fun i a = F (i -> a)
     ```
   * ```
     data Tree a = Leaf | Branch (Tree a) a (Tree a)
     ```

2. For each of those types, implement a function of the following form:

   ```
   mapF :: (a -> b) -> (F a -> F b)
   ```

   That is, implement the following functions:

   ```
   mapOption      :: (a -> b) -> (Option a -> Option b)
   mapPair        :: (a -> b) -> (Pair a -> Pair b)
   mapQuad        :: (a -> b) -> (Quad a -> Quad b)
   mapAnnotated   :: (a -> b) -> (Annotated e a -> Annotated e b)
   mapExcept      :: (a -> b) -> (Except e a -> Except e b)
   mapPrioritised :: (a -> b) -> (Prioritised a -> Prioritised b)
   mapStream      :: (a -> b) -> (Stream a -> Stream b)
   mapList        :: (a -> b) -> (List a -> List b)
   mapFun         :: (a -> b) -> (Fun i a -> Fun i b)
   mapTree        :: (a -> b) -> (Tree a -> Tree b)
   ```

   These functions must modify only the elements and preserve the overall
   structure (e.g. do not reverse the list, do not rebalance the tree, do not
   swap the pair).

   This property is witnessed by the following laws:

   ```
            mapF id  ≡  id
   mapF f ∘ mapF g   ≡  mapF (f ∘ g)
   ```

   You must implement these functions by hand, without using any predefined
   functions (not even from `Prelude`) or deriving.

Task 2
------

Create a module named `HW3.T2`. For each type from the first task
except `Tree`, implement functions of the following form:

```
distF :: (F a, F b) -> F (a, b)
wrapF :: a -> F a
```

That is, implement the following functions:

```
distOption      :: (Option a, Option b) -> Option (a, b)
distPair        :: (Pair a, Pair b) -> Pair (a, b)
distQuad        :: (Quad a, Quad b) -> Quad (a, b)
distAnnotated   :: Semigroup e => (Annotated e a, Annotated e b) -> Annotated e (a, b)
distExcept      :: (Except e a, Except e b) -> Except e (a, b)
distPrioritised :: (Prioritised a, Prioritised b) -> Prioritised (a, b)
distStream      :: (Stream a, Stream b) -> Stream (a, b)
distList        :: (List a, List b) -> List (a, b)
distFun         :: (Fun i a, Fun i b) -> Fun i (a, b)
```

```
wrapOption      :: a -> Option a
wrapPair        :: a -> Pair a
wrapQuad        :: a -> Quad a
wrapAnnotated   :: Monoid e => a -> Annotated e a
wrapExcept      :: a -> Except e a
wrapPrioritised :: a -> Prioritised a
wrapStream      :: a -> Stream a
wrapList        :: a -> List a
wrapFun         :: a -> Fun i a
```

The following laws must hold:

* Homomorphism:
  ```
  distF (wrapF a, wrapF b)  ≅  wrapF (a, b)
  ```
* Associativity:
  ```
  distF (p, distF (q, r))   ≅  distF (distF (p, q), r)
  ```
* Left and right identity:
  ```
  distF (wrapF (), q)  ≅  q
  distF (p, wrapF ())  ≅  p
  ```

In the laws stated above, we reason up to the following isomorphisms:

```
((a, b), c)  ≅  (a, (b, c))  -- for associativity
    ((), b)  ≅  b            -- for left identity
    (a, ())  ≅  a            -- for right identity
```

There is more than one way to implement some of these functions. In addition
to the laws, take the following expectations into account:

* `distPrioritised` must pick the higher priority out of the two.
* `distList` must associate each element of the first list with each element
  of the second list (i.e. the resulting list is of length `n × m`).

You must implement these functions by hand, using only:

* data types and functions that you defined in `HW3.T1`
* `(<>)` and `mempty` for `Annotated`


Task 3
------

Create a module named `HW3.T3`. For `Option`, `Except`, `Annotated`, `List`,
and `Fun` define a function of the following form:

```
joinF :: F (F a) -> F a
```

That is, implement the following functions:

```
joinOption    :: Option (Option a) -> Option a
joinExcept    :: Except e (Except e a) -> Except e a
joinAnnotated :: Semigroup e => Annotated e (Annotated e a) -> Annotated e a
joinList      :: List (List a) -> List a
joinFun       :: Fun i (Fun i a) -> Fun i a
```

The following laws must hold:

* Associativity:

  ```
  joinF (mapF joinF m)  ≡  joinF (joinF m)
  ```

  In other words, given `F (F (F a))`, it does not matter whether we join the
  outer layers or the inner layers first.

* Left and right identity:

  ```
  joinF      (wrapF m)  ≡  m
  joinF (mapF wrapF m)  ≡  m
  ```

  In other words, layers created by `wrapF` are identity elements to `joinF`.

  Given `F a`, you can add layers outside/inside to get `F (F a)`, but `joinF`
  flattens it back into `F a` without any other changes to the structure.

Furthermore, `joinF` is strictly more powerful than `distF` and can be used to
define it:

```
distF (p, q) = joinF (mapF (\a -> mapF (\b -> (a, b)) q) p)
```

At the same time, this is only one of the possible `distF` definitions (e.g.
`List` admits at least two lawful `distF`). It is common in Haskell to expect
`distF` and `joinF` to agree in behavior, so the above equation must hold.  (Do
not redefine `distF` using `joinF`, though: it would be correct but not the
point of the exercise).

Task 4
------

1. Create a module named `HW3.T4` and define the following data type in it:

   ```
   data State s a = S { runS :: s -> Annotated s a }
   ```

2. Implement the following functions:

   ```
   mapState :: (a -> b) -> State s a -> State s b
   wrapState :: a -> State s a
   joinState :: State s (State s a) -> State s a
   modifyState :: (s -> s) -> State s ()
   ```

   Using those functions, define `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` instances for `State s`.

   These instances will enable the use of `do`-notation with `State`.

   The semantics of `State` are such that the following holds:

   ```
   runS (do modifyState f; modifyState g; return a) x
     ≡
   a :# g (f x)
   ```

   In other words, we execute stateful actions left-to-right, passing the state
   from one to another.

3. Define the following data type, representing a small language:

   ```
   data Prim a =
       Add a a      -- (+)
     | Sub a a      -- (-)
     | Mul a a      -- (*)
     | Div a a      -- (/)
     | Abs a        -- abs
     | Sgn a        -- signum

   data Expr = Val Double | Op (Prim Expr)
   ```

   For notational convenience, define the following instances:

   ```
   instance Num Expr where
     x + y = Op (Add x y)
     x * y = Op (Mul x y)
     ...
     fromInteger x = Val (fromInteger x)

   instance Fractional Expr where
     ...
   ```

   So that `(3.14 + 1.618 :: Expr)` produces this syntax tree:

   ```
   Op (Add (Val 3.14) (Val 1.618))
   ```

4. Using `do`-notation for `State` and combinators we defined for it (`pure`,
   `modifyState`), define the evaluation function:

   ```
   eval :: Expr -> State [Prim Double] Double
   ```

   In addition to the final result of evaluating an expression, it accumulates
   a trace of all individual operations:

   ```
   runS (eval (2 + 3 * 5 - 7)) []
     ≡
   10 :# [Sub 17 7, Add 2 15, Mul 3 5]
   ```

   The head of the list is the last operation, this way adding another
   operation to the trace is O(1).

   You can use the trace to observe the evaluation order. Consider this
   expression:

   ```
   (a * b) + (x * y)
   ```

   In `eval`, we choose to evaluate `(a * b)` first and `(x * y)` second, even
   though the opposite is also possible and would not affect the final result
   of the computation.
