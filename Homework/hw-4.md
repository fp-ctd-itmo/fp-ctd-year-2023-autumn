Homework #4
===========

[Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/H1X21dOY)

**Note**: You may notice that these tasks mention some data types from homework 3. They are also defined in the template for this homework, namely in `HW4.Types` module, so you don't need to implement it there. However, if you think that some other parts of hw3 may be useful in this homework (e.g. you want to use `mapExcept` to implement `mapExceptState`), feel free to define these functions here as well.

Task 1
------

1. Create a module named `HW4.T1` and define the following data type in it:

   ```
   data ExceptState e s a = ES { runES :: s -> Except e (Annotated s a) }
   ```

   This type is a combination of `Except` and `State`, allowing a stateful
   computation to abort with an error.

2. Implement the following functions:

   ```
   mapExceptState :: (a -> b) -> ExceptState e s a -> ExceptState e s b
   wrapExceptState :: a -> ExceptState e s a
   joinExceptState :: ExceptState e s (ExceptState e s a) -> ExceptState e s a
   modifyExceptState :: (s -> s) -> ExceptState e s ()
   throwExceptState :: e -> ExceptState e s a
   ```

   Using those functions, define `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad`
   instances.

3. Using `do`-notation for `ExceptState` and combinators we defined for it
   (`pure`, `modifyExceptState`, `throwExceptState`), define the evaluation function:

   ```
   data EvaluationError = DivideByZero
   eval :: Expr -> ExceptState EvaluationError [Prim Double] Double
   ```

   It works just as `eval` from the previous homework but aborts the computation
   if division by zero occurs:

   * ```
     runES (eval (2 + 3 * 5 - 7)) []
       ≡
     Success (10 :# [Sub 17 7, Add 2 15, Mul 3 5])
     ```

   * ```
     runES (eval (1 / (10 - 5 * 2))) []
       ≡
     Error DivideByZero
     ```

Task 2
------

1. Create a module named `HW4.T2` and define the following data type in it:

   ```
   data ParseError = ErrorAtPos Natural

   newtype Parser a = P (ExceptState ParseError (Natural, String) a)
     deriving newtype (Functor, Applicative, Monad)
   ```

   Here we use `ExceptState` for an entirely different purpose: to parse data
   from a string. Our state consists of a `Natural` representing how many
   characters we have already consumed (for error messages) and the `String` is
   the remainder of the input.

2. Implement the following function:

   ```
   runP :: Parser a -> String -> Except ParseError a
   ```

3. Let us define a parser that consumes a single character:

   ```
   pChar :: Parser Char
   pChar = P $ ES $ \(pos, s) ->
     case s of
       []     -> Error (ErrorAtPos pos)
       (c:cs) -> Success (c :# (pos + 1, cs))
   ```

   Study this definition:

   * What happens when the string is empty?
   * How does the parser state change when a character is consumed?

   It's very helpful to understand this example before starting to implement more
   complex parsers.

4. Implement a parser that always fails:

   ```
   parseError :: Parser a
   ```

   Define the following instance:

   ```
   instance Alternative Parser where
     empty = ...
     (<|>) = ...

   instance MonadPlus Parser   -- No methods.
   ```

   So that `p <|> q` tries to parse the input string using `p`, but
   in case of failure tries `q`.

   Make sure that the laws hold:

   ```
   empty <|> p  ≡  p
   p <|> empty  ≡  p
   ```

   **Note**: It's not a mistake. You actually don't need to implement any methods in `MonadPlus` instance for `Parser` since all of them have a default implementation. 

5. Implement a parser that checks that there is no unconsumed input left (i.e.
   the string in the parser state is empty), and fails otherwise:

   ```
   pEof :: Parser ()
   ```

6. Study the combinators provided by `Control.Applicative` and `Control.Monad`.
   The following are of particular interest:

   * `msum`
   * `mfilter`
   * `optional`
   * `many`
   * `some`
   * `void`

   We can use them to construct more interesting parsers. For instance, here is a parser
   that accepts only non-empty sequences of uppercase letters:

   ```
   pAbbr :: Parser String
   pAbbr = do
     abbr <- some (mfilter Data.Char.isUpper pChar)
     pEof
     pure abbr
   ```

   It can be used as follows:

   ```
   ghci> runP pAbbr "HTML"
   Success "HTML"

   ghci> runP pAbbr "JavaScript"
   Error (ErrorAtPos 1)
   ```

7. Using parser combinators, define the following function:

   ```
   parseExpr :: String -> Except ParseError Expr
   ```

   It must handle floating-point literals of the form `4.09`, the operators `+`
   `-` `*` `/` with the usual precedence (multiplication and division bind
   tighter than addition and subtraction), and parentheses.

   Example usage:

   * ```
     ghci> parseExpr "3.14 + 1.618 * 2"
     Success (Op (Add (Val 3.14) (Op (Mul (Val 1.618) (Val 2.0)))))
     ```

   * ```
     ghci> parseExpr "2 * (1 + 3)"
     Success (Op (Mul (Val 2.0) (Op (Add (Val 1.0) (Val 3.0)))))
     ```

   * ```
     ghci> parseExpr "24 + Hello"
     Error (ErrorAtPos 3)
     ```

   The implementation must not use the `Read` class, as it implements similar
   functionality (the exercise is to write your own parsers). At the same time,
   you are encouraged to use existing `Applicative` and `Monad` combinators,
   since they are not specific to parsing.
