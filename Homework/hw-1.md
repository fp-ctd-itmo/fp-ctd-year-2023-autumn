Homework #1
===========

[Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/jqLMeisc)

Task 1
------

1. Create a module named `HW1.T1` and define the following data type in it:

   ```
   data Day = Monday | Tuesday | ... | Sunday
   ```

   (Obviously, fill in the `...` with the rest of the week days).

   Do not derive `Enum` for `Day`, as the derived `toEnum` is partial:

   ```
   ghci> toEnum 42 :: Day
   *** Exception: toEnum{Day}: tag (42) is outside of enumeration's range (0,6)
   ```

2. Implement the following functions:

   ```
   -- | Returns the day that follows the day of the week given as input.
   nextDay :: Day -> Day

   -- | Returns the day of the week after a given number of days has passed.
   afterDays :: Natural -> Day -> Day

   -- | Checks if the day is on the weekend.
   isWeekend :: Day -> Bool

   -- | Computes the number of days until Friday.
   daysToParty :: Day -> Natural
   ```

   In `daysToParty`, if it is already `Friday`, the party can start
   immediately, we don't have to wait for the next week (i.e. return `0` rather than `7`).

   <small>Good job if you spotted that this task is a perfect fit for modular
   arithmetic, but that is not the point of the exercise. The functions must
   be implemented by operating on `Day` values directly, without conversion to
   a numeric representation. </small>

Task 2
------

1. Create a module named `HW1.T2` and define the following data type in it:

   ```
   data N = Z | S N
   ```

2. Implement the following functions:

   ```
   nplus :: N -> N -> N        -- addition
   nmult :: N -> N -> N        -- multiplication
   nsub :: N -> N -> Maybe N   -- subtraction     (Nothing if result is negative)
   ncmp :: N -> N -> Ordering  -- comparison      (Do not derive Ord)
   ```

   The operations must be implemented without using built-in numbers (`Int`,
   `Integer`, `Natural`, and such).

3. Implement the following functions:

   ```
   nFromNatural :: Natural -> N
   nToNum :: Num a => N -> a
   ```

4. (Advanced) Implement the following functions:

   ```
   nEven, nOdd :: N -> Bool    -- parity checking
   ndiv :: N -> N -> N         -- integer division
   nmod :: N -> N -> N         -- modulo operation
   ```

   The operations must be implemented without using built-in numbers.

   <small>In `ndiv` and `nmod`, the behavior in case of division by zero is not
   specified (you can throw an exception, go into an inifnite loop, or delete
   all files on the computer).</small>

Task 3
------

1. Create a module named `HW1.T3` and define the following data type in it:

   ```
   data Tree a = Leaf | Branch Meta (Tree a) a (Tree a)
   ```

   The `Meta` field must store additional information about the subtree that can
   be accessed in constant time, for example its size. You can use `Int`,
   `(Int, Int)`, or a custom data structure:

   ```
   type Meta = Int         -- OK
   data Meta = M Int Int   -- OK
   ```

   Functions operating on this tree must maintain the following invariants:

   1. **Sorted**: The elements in the left subtree are less than the head element of a branch,
      and the elements in the right subtree are greater.
   2. **Unique**: There are no duplicate elements in the tree (follows from **Sorted**).
   3. **CachedSize**: The size of the tree is cached in the `Meta` field for
      constant-time access.
   4. (Advanced) **Balanced**: The tree is balanced according to one of the
      following strategies:
      * **SizeBalanced**: For any given `Branch _ l _ r`, the ratio
        between the size of `l` and the size of `r` never exceeds `3`.
      * **HeightBalanced**: For any given `Branch _ l _ r`, the difference
        between the height of `l` and the height of `r` never exceeds `1`.

   These invariants enable efficient processing of the tree.

2. Implement the following functions:

   ```
   -- | Size of the tree, O(1).
   tsize :: Tree a -> Int

   -- | Depth of the tree.
   tdepth :: Tree a -> Int

   -- | Check if the element is in the tree, O(log n)
   tmember :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Bool

   -- | Insert an element into the tree, O(log n)
   tinsert :: Ord a => a -> Tree a -> Tree a

   -- | Build a tree from a list, O(n log n)
   tFromList :: Ord a => [a] -> Tree a
   ```

   Tip 1: in order to maintain the **CachedSize** invariant, define a helper function:

   ```
   mkBranch :: Tree a -> a -> Tree a -> Tree a
   ```

   Tip 2: the **Balanced** invariant is the hardest to maintain, so implement it
   last. Search for "tree rotation".
